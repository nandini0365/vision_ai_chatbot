also there was a feature earlier where it returned whether to use our feature eye analyser or retina analyser or whether to go for doctor based on wellness checks and symptoms . now can you add it to current version. Also at the end if the user says "that's all " or something similar to it then tell " Thank you for using VisionAi . if you have any questions please free to ask!" . also remove the rectangles "that's all" and "wellness check" completely. wellness check button should be at the top only as it is right now.


also if the user matches with any of these symptoms then also it should predict and give the output

also if incase the user wishes with hello or something similar and then nothing please replay with "Hello how are you doing...." add you own lines . and then proceed
